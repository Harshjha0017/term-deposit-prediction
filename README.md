Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

Problem Statement

A Portuguese bank launched multiple telemarketing campaigns to promote a long-term **term deposit product**. Customers were contacted via telephone or cellular calls‚Äîsometimes repeatedly. Despite considerable effort, the **conversion rate remained low**, leading to wasted resources and a poor customer experience.

Business Objective

The bank aimed to:
1. Identify key factors** influencing a customer's decision to subscribe.
2. Predict which customers are likely to subscribe using demographic and interaction features.
3. Improve campaign targeting by focusing on high-potential leads while reducing over-contacting.
