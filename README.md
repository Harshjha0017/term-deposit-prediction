Term Deposit Subscription Prediction 
Problem Statement 
A bank launched multiple telemarketing campaigns to promote a long-term term deposit product. 
Customers were contacted via telephone or cellular calls—sometimes repeatedly. Despite 
considerable effort, the conversion rate remained low, leading to wasted resources and a poor 
customer experience. 
Business Objective 
The bank aimed to: 
1. Identify key factors influencing a customer's decision to subscribe. 
2. Predict which customers are likely to subscribe using demographic and interaction features. 
3. Improve campaign targeting by focusing on high-potential leads while reducing over
contacting. 
Analytical Goals 
• Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in subscription behavior. 
• Analyze campaign effectiveness across duration, contact method, timing, and past 
outcomes. 
• Build a classification model to predict if a client will subscribe (yes/no). 
• Provide actionable recommendations to: 
o Optimize calling strategy 
o Lower marketing costs 
o Improve conversion efficiency 
Business Value 
• Increased term deposit conversions 
• Lower operational and marketing costs 
• Improved customer experience 
• Data-driven campaign strategy
